Each subdirectory contains the gene trees used in the delta analysis and the delta raw output. 

Spur-Pdep-Mfra-Mnud contains the gene tree topologies for inferred single-copy orthologs for the triplet ((M. franciscanus, M. nudus), P. depressus). The gene trees were rooted on S. purpuratus, and S. purpuratus was removed from the tree. 

Mfra-Spal-Sdro-Sfra contains the gene tree topologies for inferred single-copy orthologs for the triplet ((S. droebachiensis, S. fragilis), S. pallidus). The gene trees were rooted on M. franciscanus and M. franciscanus was removed from the tree. 

Mfra-Sint-Spal-Sdro contains the gene tree topologies for inferred single-copy orthologs for the triplet ((S. droebachiensis, S. pallidus), S. intermedius). The gene trees were rooted on M. franciscanus and M. franciscanus was removed from the tree.
