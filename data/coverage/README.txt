mosdepth_unique_exon_coverage contains coverage metrics for unique exons in the S. purpuratus assembly gff3 file. Duplicate exons (exons with the same start, stop coordinates) were removed. These metrics were used to estimate the mean coverage depth for S. purpuratus exons. 

mosdepth_all_exon_coverage contains coverage metrics for all exons in the S. purpuratus assembly gff3 file. There are duplicate exons with different names for the case when an exon is part of more than one transcript. Duplicate exons were retained because these coverage metrics were used to calculate coverage of mRNA records.

mrna_coverage contains coverage metrics for mrnas in the S. purpuratus assembly gff3 file. Mean coverage depth for each mrna was calculated by taking the weighted average of all exons in the mrna (taken from /mosdepth_all_exon_coverage/). The ".regions.bed.gz" files list each transcript and its mean coverage depth. The ".thresholds.bed.gz" files list each transcript, its length, and the number of bases covered by 1x, 10x, and 20x.
