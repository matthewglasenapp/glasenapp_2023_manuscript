The directory mosdepth_unique_exon_coverage contains/ coverage metrics for unique exons in the S. purpuratus assembly gff3 file. Duplicate exons (exons with different names but identical start and stop coordinates) were removed. These metrics were used to estimate the mean coverage depth for S. purpuratus exons. 

The directory mosdepth_all_exon_coverage/ contains coverage metrics for all exons in the S. purpuratus assembly gff3 file. There are duplicate exons in cases where an exon is part of more than one transcript. Duplicate exons were retained because the coverage metrics for these exons were aggregated to calculate coverage metrics for each mRNA record.

The mrna_coverage/ directory contains coverage metrics for mRNAs in the S. purpuratus assembly gff3 file. The mean coverage depth for each mrna was calculated by taking the weighted average of all exons in the mRNA record (taken from mosdepth_all_exon_coverage/). The ".regions.bed.gz" files list each transcript and its mean coverage depth. The ".thresholds.bed.gz" files list each transcript, its length, and the number of bases covered by 1x, 10x, and 20x.
