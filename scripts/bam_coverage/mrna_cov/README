The script mrna.py calculates coverage depth metrics for a list of samples for all mRNA transcripts in the S. purpuratus reference genome assembly. Mosdepth must first be run with a regions file of all coding exons (sorted_exons.bed). mrna.py then aggregates the data from different exons of each transcript to estimate coverage data for that transcript. This script outputs a ".regions.bed.gz" file that lists each transcript and its mean coverage depth. It also outputs a ".thresholds.bed.gz" file that lists each transcript, its length, and the number of bases covered by 1x, 10x, and 20x. The script mrna_array.sh runs mrna.py as a batch array job on UCSC hummingbird.
