The script iq_species.sh uses IQ-TREE2 (https://github.com/iqtree/iqtree2) to infer a species tree from a set of single-copy orthologs. 

The script gcf.sh uses IQ-TREE2 to calculate gene and site concordance factor statistics given a species tree, a single locus tree file, and the directory containing the multiple sequence alignments for putative single-copy orthologs.
