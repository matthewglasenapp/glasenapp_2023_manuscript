The script generate_mt_tree_from_fasta.py takes an unaligned fasta file of mitochondrial genomes, aligns them using Clustal, and estimates a phylogeny using IQ-TREE. 

The file raw_mitochondrial_sequences.fasta is a fasta file of all unaligned mitochondrial genome assemblies available on NCBI for the strongylocentrotid urchin family. 

The file aligned_reformatted_raw_mitochondrial_sequences.fasta.treefile is the final treefile after clustal and IQ-TREE have been run.
