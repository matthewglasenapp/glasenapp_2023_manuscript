The script delta.py calculate the delta statistic from a file of gene trees in newick format. You must specify the triplet you are testing in the script. The tree also estimates significance by creating 10,000 bootstrap pseudoreplicate tree files with replacement. The script outputs the delta statstic, counts of the different topologies, the standard deviation of delta, and a z score. 

dep-franc has gene tree topologies for inferred single copy orthologs for the quartet ((M. franciscanus, M. nudus), P. depressus). The gene trees were rooted on S. purpuratus, and S. purpuratus was removed from the tree. 

dro-pal has gene tree topologies for inferred single copy orthologs for the quartet ((S. droebachiensis, S. fragilis), P. S. pallidus). The gene trees were rooted on M. franciscanus, and M. franciscanus was removed from the tree. 

int-pal has gene tree topologies for inferred single copy orthologs for the quartet ((S. droebachiensis, S. pallidus), S. intermedius). The gene trees were rooted on M. franciscanus, and M. franciscanus was removed from the tree. 

These trees were generated in /hb/scratch/mglasena/delta/. 

The script delta.chisq.R conduct chi-square tests for the counts of discordant gene tree topologies and outputs a p-value
